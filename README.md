# Cozmic.io

Delivering A High-Speed, High Volume Analytics and Action Framework For Almost Any Data
Cozmic.io is a reactive pattern based platform and framework that allows you to receive or collect data, analyze it and act upon it in real-time. It follows the same ideas as Reactive Streams and will provide both a Flow Based Programming interface as well as an EIP style programming interface. Some usage scenarios would include near real-time analysis of credit card transactions, analyzing data streams from biometric or home monitoring networks, or even dense and complex data like that from a flight data recorder or voice data from the next generation of cloud-enabled airplane blackboxes.Cozmic.io combines data flow management and data analysis in a reliable, high performance platform that is easy to setup and begin using. Shared memory can be used to accumulate event data or store reference data so that the analytical process may use a ‘look back on previous results or patterns as component of itself.

In a simple implementation, a developer only needs to concern themselves with the logic of processing the data. This is accomplished by writing the “Precepts” or rules for analyzing and acting on the data and if necessary writing the analysis components that suits their need. The platform can deployed as a cloud-based service that allows a high level of parallelization and the ability to run multiple versions of an application side-by-side, or it could be deployed on a dedicated appliance optimized for network connectivity and real-time analysis of data from private device networks.
